When I first began learning about accessibility, I had no idea how far it extended beyond slapping an "alt" property on to images. To make a long story short, I've learned a lot since then, but there's always more learning left to go.

A few different factors came together within the past year that cemented my dedication to accessibility. Two experiences stick out most to me.

I've become the "go-to" person at work for accessibility questions. I take this responsibility seriously. Not only do I want to provide accurate answers, I also want to provide compelling justification. It's easy to think of accessibility as an item to check off of a list. It's also easy to forget the wide range of disabilities and the diverse lived experiences of people with disabiliites. When I provide explanations for why I believe a piece of code should be implemented in a particular manner, for example, I always try to center it back on the people who we serve when we remember accessibility best practices.

Outside of work, my graduate studies also influenced me. One of the first courses I took at Georgia Tech was <a href="https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6435-digital-health-equity">Digital Health Equity</a>. I chose to research support for people with disabilities in telehealth services. As a software engineer, I typically approach accessibility as a "what" or a "how." What can I do to make an application accessible? How should I modify a particular component so that users with disabilities can use it? This class was largely research-based. There was a lot less "doing" and a lot more "thinking." We learned about different frameworks we could use to discuss health determinants and create digital approaches to solving them. I never thought about "aria" properties once, but I thought about social capital a lot.

The more I focus on accessibility at work and at school, the more I think about taking the CPACC exam. In the past, I've thought about the WAS exam. (I comb through the accessibility guidelines so often, I feel like I'm already hitting the five to ten hours of recommended study per week.) However, as I think about the months ahead of me (product launch at work! special accessibility project at school!), the CPACC exam feels even more relevant.

To celebrate this decision, I've decided to round up some of the resources I plan on using to study for the exam. I'll keep updating this list as I draw in new study material.

### [100 Days of A11y - CPACC](https://100daysofa11y.com/cpacc/)
I first learned about 100 Days of A11y for the WAS exam, but the author has also documented her experience with 
the CPACC exam, too!
