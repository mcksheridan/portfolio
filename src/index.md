Hi, my name is Sheridan, and I'm a front-end software engineer.

I primarily use React.js and TypeScript to create applications, and I'm passionate about accessibility.

Although I work full time to create software for school nurses, I'm also a graduate student pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu). I center my coursework around Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence.

Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sheridanm) or email me at [sheridan@mcksheridan.com](mailto:sheridan@mcksheridan.com).
